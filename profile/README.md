## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is NL Design Skeleton

This skeleton application is designed for rapid application testing and prototype development on the NL Design System. It provides a basic skeleton 
application with full NL Design system functionality to expand upon, viewed locally, and deployed to an online environment, viewed locally, and 
deployed to an online environment for demonstration purposes. The main benefits are:

Development and (online) demonstration of prototypes without maintaining a server.
An out-of-the-box basic application that doesn't require configuration or setup and can be extended immediately.

## NL Design

The NL Design System is an initiative of Gebruiker Centraal. The project is commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.

The NL Design System is by and for the entire government. With the central core team as the pivot, we work together with the community on a daily basis. 
For example, many different (government) organizations are working on the development of a central basis for common agreements, code and 
patterns for making digital government products.

## Open Source

As a project, we believe in open source and open community. We consciously choose to run our project openly and honestly. In addition to the 
code, all user stories and the roadmap are publicly accessible. We ask government officials and suppliers to note this and contribute actively.
