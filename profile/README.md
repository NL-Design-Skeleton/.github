# Welcome

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is NL Design Skeleton

This skeleton application is designed for rapid application testing and prototype development on the NL Design System. It provides a basic skeleton 
application with full NL Design system functionality to expand upon, viewed locally, and deployed to an online environment, viewed locally, and 
deployed to an online environment for demonstration purposes. The main benefits are:

Development and (online) demonstration of prototypes without maintaining a server.
An out-of-the-box basic application that doesn't require configuration or setup and can be extended immediately.

## NL Design

The NL Design System is an initiative of Gebruiker Centraal. The project is commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.

The NL Design System is by and for the entire government. With the central core team as the pivot, we work together with the community on a daily basis. 
For example, many different (government) organizations are working on the development of a central basis for common agreements, code and 
patterns for making digital government products.

## Open Source

As a project, we believe in open source and open community. We consciously choose to run our project openly and honestly. In addition to the 
code, all user stories and the roadmap are publicly accessible. We ask government officials and suppliers to note this and contribute actively.

## Pitch in

Governments and suppliers can contribute to this project in several ways:

- *Actively contribute to discussions*. All discussions of this project are held in the [discussion page](/orgs/NL-Design-Skeleton/discussions). Everyone 
- is free to start a discussion or participate, but the Product Owner makes the final decision together with the Steering Committee. Final decisions 
that do not lead to user stories are recorded in the [DESIGN.md](/NL-Design-Skeleton/.github/blob/main/DESIGN.md).
- *Participate in the Steering Committee*. The Steering Committee meets every two weeks and determines the [roadmap](/orgs/CommonGateway/projects/1/views/1) 
of the project. In principle, all authorities and suppliers can participate in the Steering Committee, but the final decision on participation lies 
with the Product Owner. If you are interested in participating in the Steering Committee, you can contact ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
- *Submission of feature requests*. Anyone can submit a feature request, you do not need to be a member of the Steering Committee or have development 
capacity. Feature requests are discussed by the Steering Committee that determines whether and where they will appear on the [roadmap](/orgs/CommonGateway/projects/1/views/1). Suppliers may ask for an explanation or an estimate of hours.
- *Contribution of code*. Each party is free to submit code to the project through a pull request. Please note that submitting code does not 
automatically lead to acceptance. Read the [Contributing](/NL-Design-Skeleton/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a description
of the delivery process and associated requirements.

## Roadmap

This project follows a public roadmap, which you can find under the corresponding board. No rights can be derived from the roadmap 
as it functions as an indication only. The product owner determines the roadmap in consultation with the Steering Committee. Parties that
have good ideas about the roadmap are asked to submit them. See [‚ÄúContributions‚Äù](/NL-Design-Skeleton/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
