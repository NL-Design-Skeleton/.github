#Design Decisions

We use GitHub for our code and files GitHub is a widely used solution within Common Ground, and as an open-source project it offers us enough functionality to run our project openly and for free

All design decisions are recorded in this document. This also means all final decision that did not lead to user stories are recorded here to avoid resubmission.

## Guidelines

In the NL Design System we collect documentation from the community. This can be used to start a project or optimize an existing product.

Here you will find, among other things:
- [Language Guidelines](https://www.nldesignsystem.nl/docs/richtlijnen/tekst-en-taalgebruik)
- Guidelines for Accessibility and Inclusion
- Research results of tested designs

This documentation is regularly updated.
